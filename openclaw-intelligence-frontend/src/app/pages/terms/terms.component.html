    <h2><span class="num">8.</span> AI Agent Services — Specific Terms</h2>
    <p>The following terms apply specifically to AI agent setup, management, and automation services:</p>

    <h3>8.1 Nature of AI Services</h3>
    <p>AI agents are software systems that use artificial intelligence models to perform tasks autonomously. While we strive for accuracy and reliability, AI outputs may occasionally be inaccurate, incomplete, or unexpected. You agree to implement appropriate human oversight for critical business processes.</p>

    <h3>8.2 Third-Party AI Models</h3>
    <p>Our services may utilize third-party AI model providers (including but not limited to Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and others). These providers have their own terms of service and usage policies. We are not responsible for changes to, outages of, or limitations imposed by third-party AI model providers.</p>

    <h3>8.3 Data Processing by AI Agents</h3>
    <p>You are responsible for ensuring that any data processed by AI agents complies with applicable data protection laws, including the GDPR. You must not instruct AI agents to process special category data (as defined in Art. 9 GDPR) without ensuring a valid legal basis and appropriate safeguards.</p>

    <h3>8.4 AI Output Disclaimer</h3>
    <div class="info-box"><strong>AI outputs are provided "as is."</strong> OpenClaw does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or fitness for purpose of any content generated by AI agents. You are responsible for reviewing and validating AI outputs before acting on them, especially for financial, legal, medical, or safety-critical decisions.</div>

    <h3>8.5 Usage Limits</h3>
    <p>Each service plan includes a defined allocation of AI model usage (tokens, API calls, or agent tasks). Usage beyond the allocated limits may incur additional fees, which will be communicated to you in advance.</p>
